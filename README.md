# nrsqljs
## Node Red sql.js

### This is a node-red node which provides:
* A node-red node: nrsqljs
* A node-red flow (flows.json) providing the /sqljs webservice to query the SQLITE database, based on sql.js
* An SQLITE data base manager or browser allowing to see, manipulate and create tables, it's based on JADE

### This work was possible thanks to
* [sql.js](https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/)  SQLite compiled to JavaScript through Emscripten
* [JADE](https://github.com/sunnygoyal/jade)  JAvascript based Database Editor
